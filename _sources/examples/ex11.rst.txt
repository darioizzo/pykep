This example demonstrates the use of the :class:`pykep.trajopt.lt_margo` which represents, in cartesian
coordinates, the solar electric propulsion mission of the interplanetary cubesat MARGO, studied during 2017 in
the European Space Agency's Concurrent Design Facility. The code was used to select the best candidates for the mission.

The MPCORB database object "2014 YD" is used as an example. You can also activate the Earth gravity by changing the
kwarg in the constructor.

The code for this example can be studied `here.
